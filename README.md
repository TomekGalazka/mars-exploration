## About The Project

The project is Mars Exploration Simulator. Where you can land on Mars, your Rover using the AI system is looking for water, minerals, place to live. The goal of this center is to create enough rovers to cover all the available resources within its radius (it could be several mineral spots, also water or any other resource that was included during the previous sprint). Once all these resources have an active rover assigned to it, so it can extract them and deliver them regularly to the command center, the final rover of this settlement is created. This rover will be deployed as an explorer and will attempt to find a new location suitable for a secondary base somewhere else. When it finds it, it follows the same strategy as the first rover deployed in the chart. The only difference is that once this secondary base has been completed and all its nearby resources are being extracted, then the simulation ends.

It is at that moment when we can really consider that this area is ready for human colonization.
